🚀 Published: TRIBUNAL AI Governance Framework

I'm excited to share that I've published a defensive disclosure establishing prior art for multi-agent AI deliberation systems designed for high-stakes federal decision-making.

Why publish openly?

Patent trolls shouldn't monopolize AI governance architectures that federal agencies need. By establishing prior art now, I'm preventing future monopolies while preserving my ability to build a business around the implementation.

Key innovations documented:
- Multi-agent deliberation with preserved dissent
- Quantum-resistant cryptographic audit trails (Dilithium2)
- "Silent Witness" groupthink detection for federal oversight
- Harm-asymmetric decision thresholds
- Explicit "insufficient evidence" states (AI can say "I don't know")

This follows the strategy of Bitcoin's whitepaper and Diffie-Hellman key exchange: publish the concept, protect the implementation, prevent patent monopolies.

Built for: OIG fraud investigations, DoJ compliance reviews, SEC enforcement actions

Next: Targeting federal agencies that need transparent, auditable AI decision systems with built-in dissent preservation and NIST 800-53 compliance.

Feedback welcome. If you're working on AI governance or federal compliance, I'd love to connect.
